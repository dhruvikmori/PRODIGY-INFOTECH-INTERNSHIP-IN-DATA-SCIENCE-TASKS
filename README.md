TASK-1
The figure above includes two types of visualizations: a histogram and a bar chart, each representing different aspects of a simulated population dataset.

### 1. *Histogram – Age Distribution (Left Chart)*

* *What it shows*: The histogram displays the distribution of ages in the population.
* *Interpretation*:

  * Most people are between *25 and 45 years old*, indicating a concentration around the average age (mean = 35).
  * The shape of the distribution is approximately normal (bell-shaped), suggesting most individuals are near the mean with fewer individuals at the extremes (younger or older).
  * This is useful for understanding the spread and central tendency of age in the population.

### 2. *Bar Chart – Gender Distribution (Right Chart)*

* *What it shows*: The bar chart displays the number of individuals in each gender category.
* *Interpretation*:

  * There are nearly equal numbers of *Males and Females*, each making up about half of the population.
  * A small proportion identifies as *Other*, consistent with the 2% set during simulation.
  * This type of chart is ideal for comparing counts across categorical variables like gender.

### Summary:

* The *histogram* is best for visualizing continuous data (like age), showing distribution, range, and frequency.
* The *bar chart* is best for categorical data (like gender), showing how many fall into each category.
